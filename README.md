# myblog.github.io

A minimal Jekyll setup ready to run

## What is this?

This is a skeleton for a jekyll-based blog, ready to run on github pages, say on `your-username.github.io`.

## How to use it?

1. Fork this repo to your user repository (I did it for max-mathieu.github.io)
2. Edit the `_config.yml` file (you can even do it directly on github), to set your blog title, description and twitter/github usernames
3. Edit the about.md file and be creative
4. Add posts to the _posts folder. You can look at 2017-1-1-Sample-Post for an example

## Some built-in features

### Minimal but responsive design

It's not a killer design, but that works.
You can edit colors by editing _sass/_variables.scss

### Tags

By default, there's a "tags" page that lists all tags and the posts using it.
Just add tags to the front matter of your posts

### Navigation

To show a page in the top nav, add `nav_index` to the front matter of the pages.
This allows you to toggle if they show in the nav, and at which position
