Let's pretend that this site is just a pretext to try out github pages and jekyll, so I can run this for free, just by editing a few markdown files.

## What to expect from this site?

First, feel free to look at the [jekyll skeleton](https://github.com/max-mathieu/myblog.github.io) I built for this site.
You are free to fork it to build up your own blog.

Content-wise, I just want a place where I can dump things every time I think something may be worth sharing.
It will mostly be technical with stuff about architecture, databases, back-end/API, front-end, nginx (maybe from this guy: [nginx.ninja](http://nginx.ninja)), etc.
Hopefully some machine learning stuff too.

If you like something here, have a comment or want to bash me about something here, drop me a line on Twitter. I might reply
