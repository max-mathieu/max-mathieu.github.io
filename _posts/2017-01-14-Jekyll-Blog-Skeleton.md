As stated in [my first post here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-10-First-Post %}), just before going live with this blog, I decided to split it up so anyone could fork the "core" jekyll setup, without getting all my crappy posts with it.

The result is [myblog.github.io](https://github.com/max-mathieu/myblog.github.io), with [step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/max-mathieu/myblog.github.io#how-to-use-it). It was a good experience to get to know Jekyll setup locally without having any background in Ruby, just leveraging their docs.

So feel free to fork and use it. There's a chance I'll be the only one using it, but I'll keep a close eye on issues and PR on that project for sure.
